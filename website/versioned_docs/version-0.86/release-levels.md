React Native provides the community with the ability to adopt individual new features as soon as their design and implementation are nearly complete, even before they are included in a stable release. This approach is known as **release levels**.

You can configure the release level of React Native so that your React Native instance will initialize with Feature Flags set to either `EXPERIMENTAL`, `CANARY`, or `STABLE` modes.

:::note
This approach is similar to [Canary and Experimental releases in React](https://react.dev/blog/2023/05/03/react-canaries), but with a key difference: regardless of the release level, the same version of React JS and React Native code is used.  
React Native is also not using `@canary` or `@experimental` NPM tags, as release levels are available for both stable and nightly releases of React Native.
:::

Moreover, setting the release level to `EXPERIMENTAL` or `CANARY` will **not** result in consuming `react@nightly` or `react@canary` due to how react-native is consuming the React version ([you can read more about it here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/packages/react-native/Libraries/Renderer/README.md#react--react-native-versions)).

## When to Use Each Release Level

- **`STABLE`**:
  - Use for all production apps and libraries that do not need early access to unreleased features.
  - This is the default level for stable and nightly releases.
- **`CANARY`:**
  - Use if you are a framework author, advanced app developer, or need to test or adopt new features before they are released in stable.
  - Not recommended for production or user-facing applications.
- **`EXPERIMENTAL`:**
  - Use only for testing and providing feedback for new features in the early stages of development
  - Not recommended for production or user-facing applications.

## How to initialize React Native using Canary & Experimental

### Android

The `DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint` class now has a `releaseLevel` property (default: `STABLE`).  
The feature flag system uses this property to select the appropriate set of feature flags for the chosen release level.

```kotlin title="Example usage"
DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint.releaseLevel = ReleaseLevel.CANARY
DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint.load()
```

The build system generates different feature flag override classes for each release level, ensuring the correct features are enabled for each stage.

### iOS

The `RCTReactNativeFactory` class now has an initializer that accepts a `releaseLevel` parameter. The feature flag setup uses this parameter to select the correct feature flag overrides.

<Tabs groupId="ios-language" queryString defaultValue={constants.defaultAppleLanguage} values={constants.appleLanguages}>
<TabItem value="objc">
  
```objc title="AppDelegate.mm"
[[RCTReactNativeFactory alloc] initWithDelegate:delegate releaseLevel:Canary];
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="swift">
  
```swift title="AppDelegate.swift"
let factory = RCTReactNativeFactory(delegate: delegate, releaseLevel: RCTReleaseLevel.Canary)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The system ensures that only one release level is active per app instance, and will crash if multiple factories are created with different release levels.
