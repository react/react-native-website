# Create a Library for Your Module

React Native has a rich ecosystem of libraries to solve common problems. We collect React Native libraries in the [reactnative.directory](https://reactnative.directory) website, and this is a great resource to bookmark for every React Native developer.

Sometimes, you might be working on a module that is worth extracting in a separate library for code reuse. This can be a library that you want to reuse in all your apps, a library that you want to distribute to the ecosystem as an open source component, or even a library you'd like to sell.

In this guide, you'll learn:

- how to extract a module into a library
- how to distribute the library using NPM

## Extract the Module into a Library

You can use the [`create-react-native-library`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-builder-bob/create) tool to create a new library. This tool sets up a new library with all the boilerplate code that is needed: all the configuration files and all files required by the various platforms. It also comes with a nice interactive menu to guide you through the creation of the library.

To extract a module into a separate library, you can follow these steps:

1. Create the new library
2. Move the code from the App to the Library
3. Update the code to reflect the new structure
4. Publish it.

### 1. Create a Library

1. Start the creation process by running the command:

```sh
npx create-react-native-library@latest <Name of Your Library>
```

2. Add a name for your module. It must be a valid npm name, so it should be all lowercase. You can use `-` to separate words.
3. Add a description for the package.
4. Continue filling the form until you reach the question _"What type of library do you want to develop?"_
   ![What type of Library](/docs/assets/what-library.png)
5. For the sake of this guide, select the _Turbo module_ option. Notice that you can create libraries for both New Architecture and Legacy Architecture.
6. Then, you can choose whether you want a library that access the platform (Kotlin & Objective-C) or a shared C++ library (C++ for Android and iOS).
7. Finally, select the `Test App` as last option. This option creates the library with a separate app already configured within the library folder.

Once the interactive prompt is done, the tool creates a folder whose structure looks like this in Visual Studio Code:

<img
  className="half-size"
  alt="Folder structure after initializing a new library."
  src="/docs/assets/turbo-native-modules/c++visualstudiocode.webp"
/>

Feel free to explore the code that has been created for you. However, the most important parts:

- The `android` folder: this is where the Android code lives
- The `cpp` folder: this is where the c++ code lives
- The `ios` folder: this is where the iOS code lives
- The `src` folder: this is where the JS code lives.

The `package.json` is already configured with all the information that we provided to the `create-react-native-library` tool, including the name and the description of the package. Notice that the `package.json` is also already configured to run Codegen.

```json
  "codegenConfig": {
    "name": "RN<your module name>Spec",
    "type": "all",
    "jsSrcsDir": "src",
    "outputDir": {
      "ios": "ios/generated",
      "android": "android/generated"
    },
    "android": {
      "javaPackageName": "com.<name-of-the-module>"
    }
  },
```

Finally, the library contains already all the infrastructure to let the library be linked with iOS and Android.

### 2. Copy the Code over from Your App

The rest of the guide assumes that you have a local Turbo Native Module in your app, created following the guidelines shown in the other guides in the website: platform specific Turbo Native Modules, or [cross-platform Turbo Native Modules](./pure-cxx-modules). But it works also for Components and legacy architecture modules and components. You'll have to adapt the files you need to copy and update.

{/* TODO: add links for Turbo Native Modules */}

1. **[Not required for legacy architecture modules and components]** Move the code you have in the `specs` folder in your app into the `src` folder created by the `create-react-native-library` folder.
2. Update the `index.ts` file to properly export the Turbo Native Module spec so that it is accessible from the library. For example:

```ts
import NativeSampleModule from './NativeSampleModule';

export default NativeSampleModule;
```

3. Copy the native module over:
   - Replace the code in the `android/src/main/java/com/<name-of-the-module>` with the code you wrote in the app for your native module, if any.
   - Replace the code in the `ios` folder with the code you wrote in your app for your native module, if any.
   - Replace the code in the `cpp` folder with the code you wrote in your app for your native module, if any.

4. **[Not required for legacy architecture modules and components]** Update all the references from the previous spec name to the new spec name, the one that is defined in the `codegenConfig` field of the library's `package.json`. For example, if in the app `package.json` you set `AppSpecs` as `codegenConfig.name` and in the library it is called `RNNativeSampleModuleSpec`, you have to replace every occurrence of `AppSpecs` with `RNNativeSampleModuleSpec`.

That's it! You have moved all the required code out of your app and in a separate library.

## Testing your Library

The `create-react-native-library` comes with a useful example application that is already configured to work properly with the library. This is a great way to test it!

If you look at the `example` folder, you can find the same structure of a new React Native application that you can create from the [`react-native-community/template`](https://github.com/react-native-community/template).

To test your library:

1. Navigate to the `example` folder.
2. Run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.
3. For iOS only, you need to install CocoaPods: `cd ios && pod install`.
4. Build and run Android with `yarn android` from the `example` folder.
5. Build and run iOS with `yarn ios` from the `example` folder.

## Use your library as a Local Module

There are some scenario where you might want to reuse your library as a local module for your applications, without publishing it to NPM.

In this case, you might end up in a scenario where you have your library sitting as a sibling of your apps.

```shell
Development
├── App
└── Library
```

You can use the library created with `create-react-native-library` also in this case.

1. add you library to your app by navigating into the `App` folder and running `yarn add ../Library`.
2. For iOS only, navigate in the `App/ios` folder and run `bundle exec pod install` to install your dependencies.
3. Update the `App.tsx` code to import the code in your library. For example:

```tsx
import NativeSampleModule from '../Library/src/index';
```

If you run your app right now, Metro would not find the JS files that it needs to serve to the app. That's because metro will be running starting from the `App` folder and it would not have access to the JS files located in the `Library` folder. To fix this, let's update the `metro.config.js` file as it follows

```diff
const {getDefaultConfig, mergeConfig} = require('@react-native/metro-config');

/**
 * Metro configuration
 * https://reactnative.dev/docs/metro
 *
 * @type {import('metro-config').MetroConfig}
 */
+ const path = require('path');

- const config = {}
+ const config = {
+  // Make Metro able to resolve required external dependencies
+  watchFolders: [
+    path.resolve(__dirname, '../Library'),
+  ],
+  resolver: {
+    extraNodeModules: {
+      'react-native': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/react-native'),
+    },
+  },
+};

module.exports = mergeConfig(getDefaultConfig(__dirname), config);
```

The `watchFolders` configs tells Metro to watch for files and changes in some additional paths, in this case to the `../Library` path, which contains the `src/index` file you need.
The `resolver`property is required to feed to the library the React Native code used by the app. The library might refer and import code from React Native: without the additional resolver, the imports in the library will fail.

At this point, you can build and run your app as usual:

- Build and run Android with `yarn android` from the `example` folder.
- Build and run iOS with `yarn ios` from the `example` folder.

## Publish the Library on NPM

The setup to publish everything on NPM is already in place, thanks to `create-react-native-library`.

1. Install the dependencies in your module `yarn install`.
2. Build the library running `yarn prepare`.
3. Release it with `yarn release`.

After a while, you'll find your library on NPM. To verify that, run:

```bash
npm view <package.name>
```

where `package.name` is the `name` you set up in the `package.json` file during the initialization of the library.

Now, you can install the library in your application by running:

```bash
yarn add <package.name>
```

:::note
For iOS only, whenever you install a new module with some native code, you have to reinstall CocoaPods, by running `bundle exec pod install` (recommended) or `pod install` if you are not using Ruby's Bundler (not recommended).

Congratulations! You published your first React Native library.
