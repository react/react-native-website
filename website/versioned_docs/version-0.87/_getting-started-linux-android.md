## Installing dependencies

You will need Node, the React Native command line interface, a JDK, and Android Studio.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Android Studio in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for Android.

<h3>Node</h3>

Follow the [installation instructions for your Linux distribution](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to install Node 22.11.0 or newer.

<h3>Java Development Kit</h3>

React Native currently recommends version 17 of the Java SE Development Kit (JDK). You may encounter problems using higher JDK versions. You may download and install [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net) from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or your system packager.

<h3>Android development environment</h3>

Setting up your development environment can be somewhat tedious if you're new to Android development. If you're already familiar with Android development, there are a few things you may need to configure. In either case, please make sure to carefully follow the next few steps.

<h4 id="android-studio">1. Install Android Studio</h4>

[Download and install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). While on Android Studio installation wizard, make sure the boxes next to all of the following items are checked:

- `Android SDK`
- `Android SDK Platform`
- `Android Virtual Device`

Then, click "Next" to install all of these components.

:::note
If the checkboxes are grayed out, you will have a chance to install these components later on.
:::

Once setup has finalized and you're presented with the Welcome screen, proceed to the next step.

<h4 id="android-sdk">2. Install the Android SDK</h4>

Android Studio installs the latest Android SDK by default. Building a React Native app with native code, however, requires the `Android 15 (VanillaIceCream)` SDK in particular. Additional Android SDKs can be installed through the SDK Manager in Android Studio.

To do that, open Android Studio, click on "Configure" button and select "SDK Manager".

:::tip
The SDK Manager can also be found within the Android Studio "Settings" dialog, under **Languages & Frameworks** → **Android SDK**.
:::

Select the "SDK Platforms" tab from within the SDK Manager, then check the box next to "Show Package Details" in the bottom right corner. Look for and expand the `Android 15 (VanillaIceCream)` entry, then make sure the following items are checked:

- `Android SDK Platform 35`
- `Intel x86 Atom_64 System Image` or `Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image`

Next, select the "SDK Tools" tab and check the box next to "Show Package Details" here as well. Look for and expand the "Android SDK Build-Tools" entry, then make sure that `36.0.0` and `Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)` are selected.

Finally, click "Apply" to download and install the Android SDK and related build tools.

<h4>3. Configure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable</h4>

The React Native tools require some environment variables to be set up in order to build apps with native code.

Add the following lines to your `$HOME/.bash_profile` or `$HOME/.bashrc` (if you are using `zsh` then `~/.zprofile` or `~/.zshrc`) config file:

```shell
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

:::note
`.bash_profile` is specific to `bash`. If you're using another shell, you will need to edit the appropriate shell-specific config file.
:::

Type `source $HOME/.bash_profile` for `bash` or `source $HOME/.zprofile` to load the config into your current shell. Verify that ANDROID_HOME has been set by running `echo $ANDROID_HOME` and the appropriate directories have been added to your path by running `echo $PATH`.

:::note
Please make sure you use the correct Android SDK path. You can find the actual location of the SDK in the Android Studio "Settings" dialog, under **Languages & Frameworks** → **Android SDK**.
:::

<h3>Watchman</h3>

Follow the [Watchman installation guide](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#buildinstall) to compile and install Watchman from source.

:::info
[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install) is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance and increased compatibility in certain edge cases (translation: you may be able to get by without installing this, but your mileage may vary; installing this now may save you from a headache later).

<h2>Preparing the Android device</h2>

You will need an Android device to run your React Native Android app. This can be either a physical Android device, or more commonly, you can use an Android Virtual Device which allows you to emulate an Android device on your computer.

Either way, you will need to prepare the device to run Android apps for development.

<h3>Using a physical device</h3>

If you have a physical Android device, you can use it for development in place of an AVD by plugging it in to your computer using a USB cable and following the instructions [here](running-on-device.md).

<h3>Using a virtual device</h3>

If you use Android Studio to open `./AwesomeProject/android`, you can see the list of available Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) by opening the "AVD Manager" from within Android Studio. Look for an icon that looks like this:

<img src="/docs/assets/GettingStartedAndroidStudioAVD.svg" alt="Android Studio AVD Manager" width="100"/>

If you have recently installed Android Studio, you will likely need to [create a new AVD](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html). Select "Create Virtual Device...", then pick any Phone from the list and click "Next", then select the **VanillaIceCream** API Level 35 image.

:::tip
We recommend configuring [VM acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration.html#vm-linux) on your system to improve performance. Once you've followed those instructions, go back to the AVD Manager.
:::

Click "Next" then "Finish" to create your AVD. At this point you should be able to click on the green triangle button next to your AVD to launch it.

<h3>That's it!</h3>

Congratulations! You successfully set up your development environment.
